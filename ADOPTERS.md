They were not only able to work concurrently but also captured the exact business requirements specified by the product owner in the form of example request/response pairs. These persistent mocks can now be utilized in sandbox environments if needed." See J.B. Hunt ‚≠êÔ∏è [blog post](https://microcks.io/blog/jb-hunt-mock-it-till-you-make-it/) ‚≠êÔ∏è
